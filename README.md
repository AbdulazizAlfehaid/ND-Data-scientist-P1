#### San Francisco Police Stop Data 2018-2023

This dataset provides comprehensive information on police stops conducted by the San Francisco Police Department from 2018 to 2023.
It includes details such as the date and time of the stop, duration, location, race/ethnicity of the person stopped, gender, age, reason for the stop, actions taken, search basis, property seizure, contraband or evidence found, and the results of the stop.

Motivation of the project:
the public opinion always raises assumptions about the justice of the police departments in the US, so I decided to analyze the stop data for San Francisco to see if I can find any patterns that supports or denies the allegations.

I used python to conduct this analysis. with the help of these libraries:
1- pandas
2- numpy
3- matplotlib
4- seaborn
5- plotly.express

In this repository you will find an ipynb file containing the code for the analysis named (Data Scientist_Project_Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post).
